# Agile integration with APIs & Containers: A hands-on workshop

The agile integration with APIs and containers event is a hands-on workshop for developing, testing, and deploying cloud-native, integrated solutions. This full-day workshop will start with an overview of agile integration and a discussion of the necessary architecture. We’ll also present examples of how customers are using Red Hat’s agile integration methodology to stay competitive.

The second half of the day breaks into 2 tracks for different audiences:  
- **API design and management** — For individuals leading API development and integration efforts that require some coding or development work. 
- **API development and security** — For individuals leading the API integration effort of existing services. This activity is user interface (UI) driven and will allow the integrator to successfully deploy, integrate (Red Hat Fuse), secure, and manage API services.
Each track will offer hands-on lab experience relevant to the audience.  Labs and sessions will cover accelerating the development of cloud-native applications, developing API-centric services, providing API security, and establishing operational management.
