== Overview

The focal point of your developers`' experience is the API developer portal, and the level of effort you put into it will determine the level of decreased support costs and increased developer engagement.

=== Why Red Hat?

3scale provides a built-in, state-of-the-art CMS portal, making it very easy to create your own branded hub with a custom domain to manage developer interactions and increase API adoption.

You can customize the look and feel of the entire Developer Portal to match your own branding. You have complete control over every element of the portal, so you can make it as easy as possible for developers to learn how to use your API.

=== Environment

*Credentials:*

Your username is your assigned user number. For example, if you are assigned user number *1*, your username is:

[source,bash]
----
user1
----

Please ask your instructor for your password.

*URLs:*

If you haven't done so already, you need to login to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* webpage so that a unique lab environment can be provisioned on-demand for your exclusive use.  You should open a web browser and navigate to:

[source,bash]
----
https://tutorial-web-app-webapp.dil.opentry.me

You will be presented with a login page where you can enter your unique credentials:
