= Integrator Lab 3 - Managing API Endpoints

In this lab you will be adding management capabilities to your API to give you control and visibility of it's usage.

Audience: Developers, Architects, Testers, Quality Engineers

*Overview*

Once you have APIs deployed in your environment, it becomes critically important to manage who may use them, and for what purpose. You also need to begin to track usage of these different users to know who is or is not succeeding in their usage.

*Why Red Hat?*

Red Hat provides one the leading API Management tools that provides API management services. The link:{3scale-url}[3scale API Management] solution enables you to quickly and easily protect and manage your APIs.

[id="define-api-policies"]
== Define your API Policies

Red Hat 3scale API Management provides units of functionality that modify the behavior of the API Gateway without the need to implement code. These management components are know in 3scale as policies.

The order in which the policies are executed, known as the “policy chain”, can be configured to introduce differing behavior based on the position of the policy in the chain. Adding custom headers, perform URL rewriting, enable CORS, and configurable caching are some of the most common API gateway capabilities implemented as policies.

. Scroll down and expand the **POLICIES** section to define the allowed methods on our exposed API.
+
image::images/policies-01.png[policies, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
+
_The default policy in the Policy Chain is APIcast. This is the main policy and most of the times you want to keep it._

. Click the **Add Policy** link to add a new policy to the chain.
+
image::images/policies-02.png[policies-02, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
+
_Out-of-the-box 3scale includes a set of policies you can use to modify the way your API gateway behaves. For this lab, we will focus on the **Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** one as we will use it in the consumption lab._

. Click in the **CORS** link to add the policy.
+
image::images/policies-03.png[policies-03, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Put your mouse over the right side of the policy name to enable the reorder of the chain. Drag and drop the CORS policy to the top of the chain.
+
image::images/policies-04.png[policies-04, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Now **CORS** policy will be executed before the **APIcast**. Click the **CORS** link to edit the policy.
+
image::images/policies-05.png[policies-05, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. In the *Edit Policy* section, click the green **+** button to add the allowed headers.
+
image::images/policies-06.png[policies-06, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Type **`Authorization`** in the *Allowed headers* field.
+
image::images/policies-07.png[policies-07, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Tick the **allow_credentials** checkbox and fill in with a star `*` in the _allow_origin_ text box.
+
image::images/policies-08.png[policies-08, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click twice the green **+** button under *ALLOW_METHODS* to enable two combo boxes for the CORS allowed methods.

. Select **GET** from the first box and **OPTIONS** from the second box.
+
image::images/policies-09.png[policies-09, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click the **Update Policy** button to save the policy configuration.

[id="configure-upstream-endpoint"]
== Configure the Upstream Endpoint

. Scroll back to the top of the page. Fill in the information for accessing your API.
** Private Base URL: *`http://location-service.international.svc:8080`*
** Staging Public Base URL: *`https://location-{user-username}-api-staging.amp.{openshift-app-host}:443`*
** Production Public Base URL: *`https://location-{user-username}-api.amp.{openshift-app-host}:443`*
+
_We are using the internal API service, as we are deploying our services inside the same OpenShift cluster._
+
image::images/07-baseurl-configuration.png[baseurl-configuration, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Scroll down to the **API Test GET request**.

. Type in the textbox:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
/locations
----

. Click on the **Update the Staging Environment** to save the changes and check the connection between client, gateway and API.
+
image::images/08-update-staging.png[update-staging, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
+
_If everything works, you will get a green message on the left._

. Click on **Back to Integration & Configuration** link to return to your API overview.
+
image::images/08aa-back-to-integration.png[back-to-integration, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

_Congratulations! You have configured 3scale access control layer as a proxy to only allow authenticated calls to your backend API._

* 3scale is also now:
** Authenticating (If you test with an incorrect API key it will fail)
** Recording calls (Visit the Analytics tab to check who is calling your API).

== Summary

In this lab we just covered the basics of creating a proxy for our API service. Red Hat 3scale API Management also allows us to keep track of security (as you will see in the next lab) as well as the usage of our API. If getting money from your API's is also important to you, 3scale allows you to monetize your API's with its embedded billing system.

Try to navigate through the rest of the tabs of your Administration Portal. Did you notice that there are application plans associated to your API? Application Plans allow you to take actions based on the usage of your API, like doing rate limiting or charging by hit (API call) or monthly usage.

You set up an API management service and API proxies to control traffic into your API. From now on you will be able to issue keys and rights to users wishing to access the API.

You can now proceed to link:{next-lab-url}[Lab 4].
