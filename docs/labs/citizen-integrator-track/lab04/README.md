# Lab 4

## API Security

### Securing APIs with OpenID Connect and Red Hat Single Sign On

* Duration: 20 mins
* Audience: API Owners, Product Managers, Developers, Architects

## Overview

Once you have APIs in your organization and have applications being written, you also want to be sure in many cases that the various types of users of the APIs are correctly authenticated. In this lab you will discover how to set up the widely used OpenID connect pattern for Authentication.

### Why Red Hat?

The Red Hat SSO product provides important functionality for managing identities at scale. In this lab you will see how it fits together with 3scale and OpenShift.

### Skipping The Lab

If you are planning to skip to the next lab, there is an already running OpenID Connect secured API proxy for the Location API Service in this endpoint:

```bash
https://location-sso.amp.apps.newton-46c9.openshiftworkshop.com:443
```

### Environment

**Credentials:**

Your username is your assigned user number. For example, if you are assigned user number **1**, your username is:

```bash
user1
```

Please ask your instructor for your password.

**URLs:**

If you haven't done so already, you need to login to the **Red Hat Solution Explorer** webpage so that a unique lab environment can be provisioned on-demand for your exclusive use.  You should open a web browser and navigate to:

```bash
https://tutorial-web-app-webapp.apps.newton-46c9.openshiftworkshop.com
```

You will be presented with a login page where you can enter your unique credentials:

![design-login](images/design-50.png "Login")

Enter your credentials and click **Log in**.  You'll notice a web-page appear which explains that a *unique environment* is being provisioned.

![design-login](images/design-51.png "Provision")

Once the environment is provisioned, you will be presented with a page that presents all the available applications which you'll need in order to complete the labs:

*Congratulations!* You have now an application to test your OpenID Connect Integration.

## Steps Beyond

So, you want more? Login to the Red Hat Single Sign On admin console for your realm if you are not there already. Click on the Clients menu. Now you can check that 3scale zync component creates a new Client in SSO. This new Client has the same ID as the Client ID and Secret from the 3scale admin portal.

## Summary

Now that you can secure your API using three-leg authentication with Red Hat Single Sign-On, you can leverage the current assets of your organization like current LDAP identities or even federate the authentication using other IdP services.

For more information about Single Sign-On, you can check its [page](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on).

You can now proceed to [Lab 5](../lab05/#lab-5)
