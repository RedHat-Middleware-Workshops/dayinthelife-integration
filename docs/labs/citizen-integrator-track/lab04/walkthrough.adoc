= Integrator Lab 4 - API Security

In this lab you will discover how to set up the widely used OpenID connect pattern for Authentication.

Audience: API Owners, Product Managers, Developers, Architects

*Overview*

Once you have APIs in your organization and have applications being written, you also want to be sure in many cases that the various types of users of the APIs are correctly authenticated. In this lab you will discover how to set up the widely used OpenID connect pattern for Authentication.

*Why Red Hat?*

The Red Hat SSO product provides important functionality for managing identities at scale. In this lab you will see how it fits together with 3scale and OpenShift.

*Credentials:*

Your username is: `{user-username}` +
Your password is: `{user-password}`

== Summary

Now that you can secure your API using three-leg authentication with Red Hat Single Sign-On, you can leverage the current assets of your organization like current LDAP identities or even federate the authentication using other IdP services.

For more information about Single Sign-On, you can check its https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[page].

You can now proceed to link:{next-lab-url}[Lab 5]
