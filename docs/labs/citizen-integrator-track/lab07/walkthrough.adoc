= Fuse Online and 3scale Smart Discovery Bonus Lab

In this lab you will implement a simple API with Fuse Online and expose it using 3scale.

Audience: Integrators, Developers and Architects

*Overview*

When it comes to quick API development, you need both the integration experts as well as application developers to easily develop and deploy the APIs. This lab demonstrates how to implement a simple API with Fuse Online. Instead of using APICurio to create the API contract, we use Apicurito (an embedded version of Apicurio) to define our contract directly in Fuse Online. We then implement our API with Fuse, then manage and secure it using 3scale. This flow gives us an easy end-to-end walkthrough of defining, implementing, managing and securing an API.

*Why Red Hat?*

Red Hat Fuse integration solution empowers integration experts, application developers, and business users to engage in enterprise-wide collaboration and high-productivity self-service.
