= Integrator Lab 1 - API Design

In this lab you will use Apicurio Studio to create a simple API definition using the OpenAPI Specification. You will learn how to author and download a standards compliant API Specification using Red Hat's Apicurio.

Audience: API Owner, Product Manager, Developers, Architects

*Overview*

As APIs become more widespread in the enterprise, consistent design and usage is critically important to improve reusability. The more reusable APIs are, the less friction there is for other internal or external teams to make progress. Having design standards and tools baked into the API development and maintenance process is a very powerful way to enable this consistency.

*Why Red Hat?*

Red Hat is one of the founding members of the Linux Foundation OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) which produces the leading standard for REST API specifications. Red Hat consistently uses this standard throughout its tooling, starting with the Apicurio Studio API Designer editor.

. Click on *Create New API*.
+
image::images/design-03.png[design-new-api, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Create a brand new API by completing the following information:
 ** Type: *Open API 3.0.2*
 ** Name: *Locations-{user-username}*
 ** Description: *Locations API*

+
image::images/design-04.png[design-create-api, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

== Editing APIs

You are now in the main screen to edit your APIs. Apicurio is a graphical, form-based API editor. With Apicurio you don't need master in and out all the details of the *OpenAPI Specification*. It allows you to design beautiful, functionals APIs with zero coding.

Let's start crafting your API.

. Time to prepare our data definitions for the API. Click on the *Add a datatype* link under the _Data Types_.
+
image::images/design-15.png[design-add-datatype, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Fill in the _Name_ field with the value *location*. Expand the _Enter the JSON Example (optional)_ to paste the following example, then click *Save*:
 ** Name: *location*
 ** JSON Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
  {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "International Inc Corporate Office",
      "location": {
          "lat": 51.5013673,
          "lng": -0.1440787
      },
      "type": "headquarter",
      "status": "1"
  }
----

 ** Choose to create a REST Resource with the Data Type: *No Resource*

+
image::images/design-16.png[design-JSON-Example, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
. Apicurio automatically tries to detect the data types from the provided example.

== Adding Paths

=== 3a: Add /locations path with GET method

The `/locations` path with an HTTP GET method will return a complete set of all location records in the database.

. Click on the *Add a path* link under the _Paths_ section. APIs need at least one path.
+
image::images/design-06.png[design-add-path, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Fill in the new resource path with the following information:
 ** Path: */locations*

+
image::images/design-07.png[design-path, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]
. Click *Add*.
+
_By default, Apicurio suggest a series of available operations for your new path_.

. Click *Create Operation* under the _GET_ operation.
+
image::images/design-08.png[design-create-operation, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click on the green *GET* operation button to edit the operation information.
+
image::images/design-09.png[design-get-operation, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

image::images/design-24.png[design-api-source, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

_Congratulations!_ You have created your first API definition based on the OpenAPI Specification  using Red Hat's Apicurio. Don't lose track of the file, you will use this definition for your next lab.

[time=1]
[id="step-beyond"]
== Steps Beyond

So, you want more? Did you notice the link *source* when editing the _Paths_ or the _Definitions_? Get back to the API editor and follow the link. What do you see? Apicurio lets you follow the form-based editor or go one step beyond and also lets you direct edit the source of your API definition.
