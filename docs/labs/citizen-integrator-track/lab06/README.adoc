=== Publishing APIs to Developer Portal

* Duration: 20 mins
* Audience: API Owners, Product Managers, Developers, Architects

== Overview

The focal point of your developers experience is the API developer portal, and the level of effort you put into it will directly correlate to the level of success of your API program, and API developer engagement.

=== Why Red Hat?

https://www.3scale.net/[Red Hat 3scale API Management] Solution provides a built-in, state-of-the-art CMS portal, making it very easy to create your own branded hub with a custom domain to manage developer interactions, and help increase API adoption.

You can customize the look and feel of the entire Developer Portal to match your own branding. You have complete control over every element of the portal, so you can make it as easy as possible for developers to learn how to use your API.

=== Environment

*Credentials:*

Your username is your assigned user number. For example, if you are assigned user number *1*, your username is:

[source,bash]
----
user1
----

Please ask your instructor for your password.

*URLs:*

If you haven't done so already, you need to login to the *Red Hat Solution Explorer* webpage so that a unique lab environment can be provisioned on-demand for your exclusive use.  You should open a web browser and navigate to:

[source,bash]
----
https://tutorial-web-app-webapp.dil.opentry.me
----

You will be presented with a login page where you can enter your unique credentials:

`+<img src="https://www.redhat.com/profiles/rh/themes/redhatdotcom/img/logo.png" alt="{{ provider.name }}">+`

https://github.com/Shopify/liquid[Liquid] is a simple programming language used for displaying and processing most of the data from the 3scale system available for API providers. In 3scale, it is used to expose server-side data to your API developers, greatly extending the usefulness of the CMS while maintaining a high level of security.
