= Integrator Lab 2 - API Mocking

In this lab you will use Microcks to configure a REST mock service for the API definition you created in the previous lab. REST mock services allows you to simulate a REST API service when you are in a prototyping stage of your API program journey. 

Audience: Developers, Architects, Testers, Quality Engineers

*Overview*

When building and working with APIs, you often need to simulate the responses of the system before it has been fully completed. This is what we explore in this workshop - mocking up API structures quickly so they can be subjected to testing without having to create all the final service code.

*Why Red Hat?*

Red Hat combines a number of commercial and Open Source tools to cover each part of the API Design lifecycle. In this lab we'll be using the http://microcks.github.io/[Microcks] open source tool.

*Skipping The Lab*

If you are planning to follow the next lab, here is a link:wip-link[link] to the REST mock service running the Location API.

_Congratulations! The spec is successfully imported_

. Navigate to **APIs | Services** tab.

. You can check that the example we added to the definition in Lab 1 will be used to return the mock values. Copy and save the *Mocks URL*, we will use that endpoint to test the REST mock service.

.Testing

* link:{testing-url}[cURL Online, window="_blank"]

We now have a working REST mock service listening for requests. We will use an online cURL tool to test it.

. Navigate to link:{testing-url}[cURL Online, window="_blank"]

. Enter the copied URL from previous step. It should look like this:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
 http://microcks.{openshift-app-host}/rest/Locations-{user-username}/1.0.0/locations
----

. Click the *START YOUR CURL* button.
+
image::images/mock-18.png[mock-curl-service, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. The page will load the response information from the service. You will be able to see the _RESPONSE HEADERS_ and the actual _RESPONSE_BODY_. This last part contains the examples we add during the design phase.

_Congratulations!_ You have successfully configure a Microcks Job to create a REST mock service to test your API.

== Summary

In this lab you used Microcks to configure a REST mock service for the API definition you created in the previous lab. REST mock services allows you to simulate a REST API service when you are in a prototyping stage of your API program journey.

Microcks allows you to test a number of various responses for client application requests. When deploying API, micro-services or SOA practices at large scale, Microcks solves the problems of providing and sharing consistent documentation and mocks to the involved teams. It acts as a central repository and server that can be used for browsing but also by your Continuous Integration builds or pipelines.

You can now proceed to Lab 3.
